Course: Workshop on Operations Research and Optimization Methods

Objective:
Given the tri-objective optimization problem  solve this problem 
at dimension n = 30 using the SMS-EMOA (as a black-box problem).
Provide 3D plots (scatter + surfaces) for the Pareto surfaces obtained 
when run no longer than 30min.

Results:
